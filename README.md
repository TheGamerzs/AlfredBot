# Breakdown

## Processing Commands

The index.js file is where everything is brought together. Inside of this file is where Alfred logs in, registers all the slash commands, and registers loads command logic. When Alfred detects a message, he processes it to check for the correct prefix (in this case a '.') and then tries to find the specified command in either the Discord servers folder (RTScommands for RTS Discord and PIGScommands for PIGS Discord) or the Bothcommands folder. If it finds the specified command it will run the function inside of that file.

## External Files

There are 2 html files for Alfred. These are the voucher pictures for each company and I use them to render the image for each individual person. If you view the source for the html files you will see a lot of {{double curly brackets}}. This is where I insert the data specific to the member before processing the file and sending the result to Discord.

# Commands

Each command has helpful descriptions of what they do and what arguments they take. The general format goes:

```js
// Imports and constants
module.exports.run = async (bot, args) => {
	// command logic
	return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
		// returns a   promise

		resolve('This is what is sent');
		// or
		resolve(['send', 'multiple', 'things']);
		// or
		reject('This is an error');
	});
};

module.exports.help = {
	name: 'COMMAND_NAME', // .COMMAND_NAME
	aliases: ['cmd_name', 'cmd_nme'], //.cmd_name, .cmd_nme
	usage: '<required> [optional arg]',
	description: 'A helpful description',
	permission: [
		...botconfig.OWNERS,
		...botconfig.MANAGERS,
		...botconfig.EMPLOYEES,
		...botconfig.MEMBERS,
	], // who can use it
	slash: true, // if command is slash
	args: [], // arguments as described in usage (view other commands for examples, this is in discords slash command format with an added parse function)
	hidden: false, // if response should be hidden
	slow: false, // if command takes a while to respond
};
```

# Database

The Holy Spirit of this whole project. This allows us to easily keep track of everyone while also keeping commands quick.

The database has 6 tables. managers, members, payout, pigs, rts, and applicants.

## managers

The manager table keeps a list of every manager and how many vouchers they have collected for each company.

This table has 6 columns. discord_id, rts_cashout, total_money, rts_cashout_worth, pigs_cashout, and pigs_cashout_worth

## members

The members table keeps track of every member in the company, both fired and hired.

This table has 9 columns. in_game_id, discord_id, in_game_name, company, deadline, fire_reason, last_turnin, num and warnings

## payout

The payout table keeps track of every payout made by a manager.

This table has 7 columns. manager_id, player_id, current_company, vouchers_turned_in, time, payed_money, primary

## pigs

The pigs table keeps track of member stats for the pigs company.

This table has 3 columns. in_game_id, pigs_total_vouchers, and pigs_total_money

## rts

The rts table keeps track of member stats for the rts company.

This table has 3 columns. in_game_id, rts_total_vouchers, and rts_total_money

# Installation

To clone and run this bot, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Gabolicious/AlfredBot.git

# Install dependencies
$ npm install
```

Inside the repository create a file called `botconfig.json`. Obviously I can't show you exactly what my botconfig looks like but this is the bare essentials.
